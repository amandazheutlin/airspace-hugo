  title: Graduate Application International Network
  description: 2020-present, University of Zurich
  content: The Graduate Application International Network (GAIN) is an initiative 
    founded at the University of Zurich to create a pipeline for African students 
    to access graduate programs in economics. After a pilot in collaboration with 
    IPA Kenya in 2019, we have expanded across Sub-Saharan Africa. Our program entails 
    a webinar series to demystify the application process, one-on-one mentoring to help 
    them complete the process, and financial support for application and test fees. 
    I directed the program during 2020 and 2021 and continue to serve as a mentor 
    and strategic advisor.

  title: Herb Scarf Summer Research Program
  description: 2017-2019, Yale University
  content: "Herb Scarf Summer Research Opportunities in Economics (HSSRO) is a 
    program designed to give Yale undergraduates a chance to explore a career in 
    economic research. Students work closely with professors on every aspect of the 
    research process, from data collection to coding to writing. The program curriculum 
    includes a seminar series by Yale faculty and graduate students, a six-week 
    workshop in statistical programming and research skills, and social events to 
    foster an active community. I helped design the program in 2017 and codirected it for 3 years."
