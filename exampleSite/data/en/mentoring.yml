  title: Graduate Application International Network
  description: Executive Director, 2020-present, University of Zurich
  content: |-
    The Graduate Application International Network (GAIN) is an initiative founded at the University of Zurich to create a pipeline for African students to access graduate programs in economics. After a pilot in collaboration with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) Kenya in 2019, we have expanded to eight countries in East and West Africa in 2020. Our program entails a webinar series to demystify the application process, one-on-one mentoring to help them complete the process, and financial support for application and test fees.

    As Executive Director, I oversee a team of six people. Together, we organized webinars attended by dozens of applicants, recruited and matched mentors from top PhD programs, helped secure over $100,000 to fund application and test fees, and developed new international partnerships for the future.

  title: Herb Scarf Summer Research Program
  description: Co-Director, 2017-2019, Yale University
  content: "Herb Scarf Summer Research Opportunities in Economics (HSSRO) is a program
    designed to give Yale undergraduates a chance to explore a career in economic
    research. Students work closely with professors on every aspect of the research
    process, from data collection to coding to writing. The program curriculum includes
    a seminar series by Yale faculty and graduate students, a six-week workshop in
    statistical programming and research skills, and social events to foster an active
    community. \n\nIn 2017, I took over as Graduate Director to create this curriculum
    and transform the program from a collection of summer jobs into a comprehensive
    pre-doctoral experience. "
