  title: Graduate Application International Network
  description: 2020-present, University of Zurich
  content: |-
    The Graduate Application International Network (GAIN) is an initiative founded at the University of Zurich to create a pipeline for African students to access graduate programs in economics. After a pilot in collaboration with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) Kenya in 2019, we expanded across East and West Africa in 2020 and 2021. Our program entails a webinar series to demystify the application process, one-on-one mentoring to help them complete the process, and financial support for application and test fees.

    As a Program Director, I oversee a team of six people. Together, we organize webinars attended by hundreds of applicants, recruit and match mentors from top PhD programs, secure grants to fund application and test fees, and develop new international partnerships in academia.

  title: Herb Scarf Summer Research Program
  description: 2017-2019, Yale University
  content: "Herb Scarf Summer Research Opportunities in Economics (HSSRO) is a program
    designed to give Yale undergraduates a chance to explore a career in economic
    research. Students work closely with professors on every aspect of the research
    process, from data collection to coding to writing. The program curriculum includes
    a seminar series by Yale faculty and graduate students, a six-week workshop in
    statistical programming and research skills, and social events to foster an active
    community. \n\nIn 2017, I took over as Graduate Director to create this curriculum
    and transform the program from a collection of summer jobs into a comprehensive
    pre-doctoral experience. "
