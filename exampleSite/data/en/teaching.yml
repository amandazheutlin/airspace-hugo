  title: Decision Making with Data
  content: "We designed this course to give students a chance to use statistics in
    real-world settings. Each week, we give them a case study asking an open-ended
    question within a particular industry. Using real-world data and the statistical
    tools they learned in core courses, they work in teams to design an answer and
    present it to a potential client. In addition to reviewing key theoretical concepts
    such as OLS regression, we teach students practical skills such as statistical
    programming and data visualization.\n\nTogether with my advisor, Peter Schott,
    I have developed this course over the past three years, creating a new case study
    each year, lectures on statistical programming in R, and a practical guide to
    data analysis and visualization. "
