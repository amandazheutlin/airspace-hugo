  title: 'Unfair Trade: Market Power in Agricultural Value Chains'
  description: Under review.
  content: I show that market power among exporters is a key driver of low farmer
    income in agricultural value chains. Using novel microdata from Ecuador, I document
    low farmer income and high exporter concentration across a wide range of crops.
    I propose a model of farmer crop choice and exporter strategic interaction that
    links farmer income to exporter concentration via two elasticities, which govern
    heterogeneity in farmer costs of switching crops and switching exporters. The
    estimated model implies that farmer income would be 77% higher if exporters behaved
    competitively. Counterfactual Fair Trade policies achieve up to half of the benefits
    from perfect competition, suggesting a practical method for counteracting market
    power.

  title: Quality Regulation Creates and Reallocates Trade
  description: with Ana Fernandes, Ryan Haygood, Tristan Reed, and Jose Daniel Reyes. Under
    review.
  content: Quality regulation has become the dominant instrument of trade policy. 
    Panel evidence shows that regulations classified as sanitary and phytosanitary 
    measures and technical barriers to trade both increase trade on average. Other 
    non-tariff measures like quotas decrease trade. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures 
    reallocate trade from lower-income exporting countries to higher-income exporting 
    countries, while technical barriers to trade measures do the opposite. Sanitary and 
    phytosanitary and technical barriers to trade measures increase the sales concentration 
    of exporting firms from lower-income countries, but do not affect the concentration 
    of exporting firms from higher-income countries or importing firms. The costs of 
    quality regulation are primarily borne by exporting firms, especially in lower-income 
    countries.

  title: The Value of Organic Certification
  description: 'with Ignacio Marra de Arti√±ano, Franco Riottini Depetris, Gabriel Scattolo, and
    Christian Volpe Martincus. Draft coming soon. '
  content: "Consumer taste for organic products has grown, increasing demand and costs along 
    agricultural value chains. We estimate the impact of the world\'s largest certification system
    -- USDA organic -- on exporters from one of the world\'s most important organic production regions
    -- Latin America. To do so, we use a novel dataset that combines the universe of agricultural 
    export transactions from 10 countries in Latin America with the universe of organic certifications 
    granted by the USDA since 2012. Our results indicate that certified firms increase exports 
    to the USA relative to non-certified firms. We develop a model of selection into organic certification, 
    which allows us to decompose the estimated impacts into cost and demand channels.  "

  title: "Technology, Tax, and Domestic Trade: Evidence from Rwanda\'s Electronic Invoicing Expansion"
  description: with Pierre Bachas, Kieran Byrne, John Karangwa, and Florence Kondylis. Draft coming soon.
  content: 'Digital technology facilitates trade but also increases the visibility of firms
    activity to the government. This paper examines the trade-off between technology adoption and 
    regulatory exposure in the context of electronic billing machines (EBM) and business taxation 
    in Rwanda. In December 2020, the government mandated that large firms tax deductions for 
    purchases be validated by corresponding EBM receipts. Using a shift-share design, we find that 
    receipt demand from large clients predicts EBM adoption and growth of small suppliers. We combine 
    a model of invoicing in supply chains and a nationwide survey of firms to shed light on the 
    underlying mechanisms. '
