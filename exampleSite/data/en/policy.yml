  title: Policy & Outreach
  content: Policy is at the heart of my work. For my dissertation, I partner with
    the Ecuadorian government and the World Bank to answer policy-relevant questions
    with administrative data from millions of firms and individuals. In the process,
    I publish shorter studies for policy audiences. I have traveled to Ecuador and
    Chile to conduct field research, present findings, and lead data science workshops
    for practitioners.
