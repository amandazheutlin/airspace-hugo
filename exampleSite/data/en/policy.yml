  title: Policy Impact
  content: Policy impact is at the heart of my work. I partner with World Bank teams 
    and government agencies around the world to answer policy-relevant questions with 
    rigorous evidence. I have contributed to several policy publications, most notably 
    the 2025 World Development Report. I have worked closely with policymakers in Ecuador, 
    Chile, Honduras, and Rwanda.
